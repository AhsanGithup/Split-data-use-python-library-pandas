### **Report**

#### **Objective**:
The purpose of this report is to document the data cleaning process performed on the dataset containing the columns **Id**, **CreationDate**, and **Tags**. The goal is to ensure the dataset is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis or further processing.

---

#### **Dataset Overview**:
The dataset consists of the following columns:
1. **Id**: A unique identifier for each record.
2. **CreationDate**: The date and time when the record was created.
3. **Tags**: Keywords or labels associated with the record.

---

#### **Data Cleaning Steps**:

1. **Id Column**:
   - **Issue**: Duplicate or missing `Id` values can lead to incorrect data analysis.
   - **Actions Taken**:
     - Checked for duplicate `Id` values using `df.duplicated('Id')`. Duplicates were removed to ensure each record has a unique identifier.
     - Verified for missing values using `df['Id'].isnull().sum()`. Missing values were either filled or the corresponding rows were dropped, depending on the use case.
     - Ensured the `Id` column is of integer type using `df['Id'].astype(int)`.
   - **Outcome**: The `Id` column is now clean, with no duplicates or missing values, and is stored as an integer.

2. **CreationDate Column**:
   - **Issue**: Incorrect or missing date formats can cause errors in time-based analysis.
   - **Actions Taken**:
     - Converted the `CreationDate` column to a proper datetime format using `pd.to_datetime(df['CreationDate'])`.
     - Identified and handled missing values using `df['CreationDate'].isnull().sum()`. Missing dates were either filled with a default value or the corresponding rows were dropped.
     - Validated the date range to ensure no future dates are present. Rows with future dates were removed.
   - **Outcome**: The `CreationDate` column is now in a consistent datetime format, with no missing or invalid dates.

3. **Tags Column**:
   - **Issue**: Tags often contain inconsistent formatting, special characters, or missing values, which can hinder analysis.
   - **Actions Taken**:
     - Removed unwanted characters (e.g., `<`, `>`, and extra spaces) using string operations like `str.replace()`.
     - Split tags into lists for easier analysis and processing.
     - Handled missing or empty tags by replacing them with a placeholder (e.g., "No Tags").
   - **Outcome**: The `Tags` column is now clean, standardized, and ready for further analysis.

---

#### **Summary of Findings**:
- **Id Column**: Duplicates and missing values were resolved, and the column was standardized to integer type.
- **CreationDate Column**: Dates were converted to a consistent format, and invalid or missing dates were handled.
- **Tags Column**: Tags were cleaned, standardized, and missing values were addressed.


---

#### **Conclusion**:
The data cleaning process has successfully addressed issues in the **Id**, **CreationDate**, and **Tags** columns. The dataset is now clean, consistent, and ready for analysis or further processing.
